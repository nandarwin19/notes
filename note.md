## Next.js font

Next.js automatically optimizes fonts in the application when you use the next/font module. It downloads font files at build time and hosts them with your other static assets. This means when a user visits your application, there are no additional network requests for fonts which would impact performance.

---

```

import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';

export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

what is subset?
By using a subset, you can reduce the size of the font file that needs to be loaded, which can improve the performance and loading times of your application.

"Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })" returns an object which is contained className. So we use like that

<body className={`${inter.className} antialiased`}>{children}</body>

```

## The `<Image>` component

Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.
Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport.
Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport).
Serving images in modern formats, like WebP and AVIF, when the browser supports it.

quality

quality={75} // {number 1-100}
The quality of the optimized image, an integer between 1 and 100, where 100 is the best quality and therefore largest file size. Defaults to 75

## That is called root segment, segment, leaf segment

![Alt Text](./image/n1.jpg)

## Link (import Link from 'next/link')

Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the linked route in the background. By the time the user clicks the link, the code for the destination page will already be loaded in the background, and this is what makes the page transition near-instant!

Server components allow you fetch data directly from your database.

Why might static rendering not be a good fit for a dashboard app?
Because the application will not reflect the latest data changes
When your data updates, you want to show the latest changes in your dashboard. Static Rendering is not a good fit for this use case.

## What is Static Rendering?

Faster Websites
Reduced Server Load
SEO

## What is Dynamic Rendering?

Real-Time Data
User-Specific Content
Request Time information

```

export async function fetchLatestInvoices() {
noStore();
// ...
}

```

"Should not be cached" means responses should not be stored due to:

- Sensitive information (e.g., passwords).
- Dynamic data (e.g., stock prices).
- User-specific data (e.g., personalized info).
- Session-specific data (e.g., shopping carts).

Use `no-store` to prevent caching and ensure up-to-date data from the server.

Streaming in Next.js works with React's component model:

At the page level with loading.tsx.
For specific components with <Suspense>.

## useSearchParams, usePathname

useSearchParams- For example, the search params for this URL /dashboard/invoices?page=1&query=pending would look like this: {page: '1', query: 'pending'}.
usePathname - For example, for the route /dashboard/invoices, usePathname would return '/dashboard/invoices'

## defaultValue vs. value / Controlled vs. Uncontrolled

If you're using state to manage the value of an input, you'd use the value attribute to make it a controlled component. This means React would manage the input's state.

However, since you're not using state, you can use defaultValue. This means the native input will manage its own state. This is okay since you're saving the search query to the URL instead of state.

---

## useSearchParams() VS searchParams

Use `useSearchParams()` for client-side access to avoid unnecessary server requests. Use the `searchParams` prop for server-side components to fetch data directly.

## Debouncing

Debouncing limits how often a function runs. It starts a timer on event trigger (e.g., keystroke). If another event occurs before the timer ends, the timer resets. The function runs only when the timer completes without interruption. By debouncing, you can reduce the number of requests sent to your database, thus saving resources.

You can use "use-debounce"

## What is wireframe vs UI?

In summary, a wireframe is a blueprint of the structure and layout of a website or application, while UI design is the process of designing the visual elements and interactions of the user interface.

The CSS Grid is useful for two-dimensional layout, providing tools for aligning elements across rows and columns, while the CSS Flexbox is useful for positioning items in a one-dimensional layout.

## Gird

```

<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
  <div class="item">Item 4</div>
  <div class="item">Item 5</div>
  <div class="item">Item 6</div>
</div>

.container {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 150px);
grid-gap: 10px;
}

```

## Flexbox

```

<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
</div>

.container {
display: flex;
justify-content: space-between;
}

```

## [LEARN ADVANCED REACT](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-advanced-react)

**Effect hooks** are useful for ‚Äúside effects‚Äù such as fetching data or reacting to state changes.

## What is porp drilling?

The prop is ‚Äúdrilled‚Äù from a high-level component down through middle-level components down to a low-level component.

## Why we will use Context API?

because to get rid of prop drilling and unneccessary passing props

## React Context

‚Ä¢ Prop drilling: Passing data through multiple components.
‚Ä¢ Context: Avoids prop drilling by providing shared state to child components.
‚Ä¢ Provider component: Wraps child components and provides access to state.
‚Ä¢ Consumer components: Subscribe to context value using useContext() hook.
‚Ä¢ State management: Providers can hold state and state updater functions.
‚Ä¢ Consider alternative state management options (Redux, useReducer, useState).

### REACT ERROR BOUNDARIES

You can use that popular library instead of creating your own error boundary
Implementing react-error-boundary

```

import { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary';

function ErrorFallback({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) {
return (

<div>
<h2>An error occurred in the app!!</h2>
<p>Error: {error.message}</p>
<button onClick={resetErrorBoundary}>
Reset
</button>
</div>
);
}

function App() {
return (
<ErrorBoundary onError={logError} FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>
<MyComponent/>
</ErrorBoundary>
);
}

```

### Passing Props to Fallback Components

```

function ErrorFallback({ error, resetErrorBoundary, newProp }) {
// Handle the error / resetErrorBoundary logic...
// But now we also have the newProp value!
}

// Later in some rendered JSX...
<ErrorBoundary
FallbackComponent={(props) => (
<ErrorFallback {...props} newProp={"foo"} />
)}

>

```

Error boundaries can catch errors that occur during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them. Error boundaries do not catch errors for event handlers, asynchronous code, server-side rendering, or errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children).

**Example**

```

function ErrorFallback({ error, resetErrorBoundary, newMessage }) {
const handleReset = () => {
resetErrorBoundary();
};

// Use the newMessage prop to customize the error message
return (

<div>
<p>{newMessage || 'Oops, an error occurred!'}</p>
<p>Error details: {error.message}</p>
<button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
</div>
);
}

```

#### Where should error boundaries be used in a React application?

As close as possible to the components that are potential sources of runtime errors.

```

import React from 'react';
import { logError } from './error-logging-service';

export default class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
constructor(props) {
super(props);
this.state = { error: null };
this.reset = this.reset.bind(this);
// bind reset function
}

// define reset function
reset() {
this.setState({error: null})
}
static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
return { error };
}

componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
logError(error, errorInfo);
}

render() {
if (this.state.error) {
return (

<div className="error">
<h2>An error was detected!</h2>
<button onClick={this.reset}>Reset</button>
</div>
);
}
return this.props.children;
}
}

```

Do you know how to use React Profiler? react developer tools?

### What is a higher-order component?

A higher-order component is a design pattern where a component takes in a component and returns a new component with extra functionality.

## [React Testing](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-react-testing/)

[Install Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

We need to match the following name conventions to run our tests:

- files with names ending in .test.js
- files with names ending in .spec.js
- .js files within a **tests**/ directory

```

Our file structure will look like this:

src/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Button/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Button.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Button.test.js

```

### [command line flags](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#reference)

### .toBe() vs .toEqual (matcher method)

The .toBe() matcher is used to compare simple data types for equality, while the .toEqual() matcher is used for deep equality comparisons

```

//file: recipes.test.js

// import the function to test
import { getIngredients } from "./recipes.js";

it("Gets only the ingredients list for Pesto", () => {
//arrange
const pestoRecipe = {
'Basil': '2 cups',
'Pine Nuts': '2 tablespoons',
'Garlic': '2 cloves',
'Olive Oil': '0.5 cups',
'Grated Parmesan': '0.5 cups'
}
const expectedIngredients = ["Basil", "Pine Nuts", "Garlic", "Olive Oil", "Grated Parmesan"]

//act
const actualIngredients = getIngredients(pestoRecipe);

//assert
expect(actualIngredients).toEqual(expectedIngredients)
});

```

### Testing async code with Jest (Done)

```

it("correctly fetches a list of countries", (done) => {
const inputLanguageCode = "es";
const expectedValue = "Argentina";

countryListLookup(inputLanguageCode, (result) => {
try {
expect(result).toBeDefined();
done()
} catch (error) {
done(error)
}
});
});

```

### Testing async code with Jest (async, await)

```

it("correctly fetches a list of countries", async () => {

const inputLanguageCode = "es";
const expectedValue ="Argentina";

const actualValue = await countryListLookup(inputLanguageCode);

expect(actualValue).toContain(expectedValue);
});

```

### When should I use `done()` and `async/await`?

Although both are functionally similar, their uses can help make your test code more readable. You should use done() for asynchronous code that uses callbacks, while async/await is best suited for code that returns Promises. Choosing the appropriate method can help make your code more readable and easier to understand.

# 16/5/2024

### What is assertion library and test runner?

The assertion library is the set of functions for making assertions, like expect().toBe(). The test runner is the command-line tool for executing Jest test files.

### [Jest assertions](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect)

### [Queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/)

```

Mimicking user interactions in ReactJS involves simulating user events like clicks, form submissions, and keypresses during testing. React Testing Library, Jest, and Enzyme are commonly used for this purpose.

Example with React Testing Library:

import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

test('simulates click event', async () => {
const handleClick = jest.fn();
render(<MyComponent onClick={handleClick} />);
await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});

```

### What is React Testing Library (RTL)?

React Testing Library (RTL) is a library for testing React components. It encourages testing components from a user perspective by focusing on interactions and DOM elements rather than component internals. RTL provides utilities to query and interact with DOM nodes in a way that resembles how users would interact with the application.

Key features:

Emphasizes testing behavior over implementation.
Provides methods for querying DOM elements by their roles, text, labels, etc.
Supports asynchronous testing for components that rely on state changes or API calls.
