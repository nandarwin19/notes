Micheal, in business it’s not about hard work. It’s about who you can attract and keep customers. At a profit.

And customers don’t really care about how much time went into cooking up those meatballs you serve, or how much money you pay your staff.

All they want is to get THEIR wants and needs met. Success in business is about evoking emotions in your customers. And if you ever want to make it….You’ve got to learn how to attract instead of chase customers. People should WANT to spend money with you. You’ve got to learn to sell, man.

First of all, I want to congratulate you for thinking about things like this at such a young age.

While most of your peers are thinking about how they can score booze for a house party this weekend or who said what in the cafeteria this week, you’re focused on a future vision of success.

So well done…

I managed to build a 7-figure business by the time I was 30 and I could have done it MUCH sooner if I’d focused on the following things from such a young age.

Here are the 7 essential things you must learn in order to become a multi millionaire in your early 20’s…

1. Learn About YOURSELF

You will never achieve lasting success and fulfillment if you don’t know yourself.

At 16, you are still so young that you have not fully developed into the person that you will one day be.

And this is a good thing.

Because you have a chance to change yourself into the person you want to be without spending years to undo damage from your childhood.

Spend time learning about yourself.

Learn about your personality, your learning style, what motivates you, what de-motivates you, how you respond to stress, and how you adopt new habits.

Once you understand who you are now, you can start to make subtle shifts to turn yourself into the person you want to be tomorrow.

All success is rooted in self knowledge.

Take the time to “Know thyself” and the rest of these steps will be MUCH easier.

2. Learn About High Performance and Personal Development

Once you learn about yourself, you must take time to learn more about high performance and personal development.

Success leaves clues.

The multi millionaires that you admire and aspire to be like, they didn’t achieve success by accident.

They did it by following a formula. By following a set of habits and activities that helped them achieve success.

So, while you’re young, take time to understand peak performance.

Read books on psychology, personal development, habits, and high performance.

Learn how the 1% thinks and behaves differently from the 99%.

By doing this you will allow yourself to start your journey to wealth from a place of power and understanding instead of ignorance.

3. Learn About How Money Works

If you want to make lots of money, then you must become intimately familiar with the language of money.

Even if you have no intention of going to college, it’s a good idea to study economics, finances, and investment theory while you’re in your teens.

Learn how investors analyze opportunities.

Understand the metrics that rich people pay attention to in business.

Learn about appreciation, inflation, capital gains, taxation and anything else related to money.

If I had done this, I could have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in my 20’s and possibly earned millions more.

4. Learn About the Psychology of Sales and Marketing

Everything in business boils down to sales and marketing.

Yes…

Having a great product is important.

But in the end, if you don’t know how to promote and sell that product, you don’t have a business, you have a prototype.

EVERYTHING hinges on your ability to market and sell your product and service.

If you can, get a commission only sales job the second you turn 18.

Read everything from Brian Tracy, Zig Ziglar, and Grant Cardone.

Subscribe to 50+ newsletters and pay attention to how bloggers and online marketers write emails to capture attention and sell products.

Write down notes about advertisements that catch your attention.

Master these two critical skills and you can become a multi millionaire without ever having a business of your own (#consulting).

5. Learn About Other Multi-Millionaires

Reading about sales, marketing, and personal development is great.

But reading the autobiographies of famous millionaires will give you a unique opportunity to get inside of their head and see how they think.

Buy the biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Rockefeller, Ray Kroc (McDonalds), and Hilton.

Learn about how they did business.

Examine their character and their mindsets.

Absorb everything that you can from them and then do what they did.

Success leaves clues.

But you need to know where to look for those clues.

6. Learn About Life… By Experiencing It

If you want to become wealthy in the most sustainable and FUN way possible, then get out of your hometown and go live life.

Forget about money for a few years and instead try to live the most fulfilling life possible.

Travel the world.

Apprentice under interesting people.

Learn as much as you can about how the world really works.

Have a wealth of experiences to draw from.

Because the best businesses aren’t the ones that are designed to make the most money.

They are the businesses that solve the best problems.

And you can’t identify these problems (or their solutions) until you’ve gone out and lived a crazy life for a little while!

7. Learn to Be Patient

Above all, wealth requires patience.

Hustle your butt off. Yes.

Work until sun up if you must. Sure.

But always remember that money takes time.

It may take you 5 years or it may take you 20.

But if you stick it out, focus on the process, and learn from people who are smarter than you, you can and will achieve lasting success and millions in the bank.

Now go and do it!

Stay Grounded,
Andrew
